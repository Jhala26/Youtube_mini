<h1>About Project</h1>
<p>I have created this Mini YouTube App which can only work online. It is created on Dummy YouTube API through which you can search your required things and can watch them also on the same server. It will also show you the trending videos as you can see in the real YouTube App and you can play them too on the same server. It is a completely working and Responsive web Application.</p>
